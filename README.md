Stock tracking and social network app using Rails 6 with Bootstrap for [The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course](https://github.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course).

This features interactive user sign-up and profile management using `Devise` as well as API integration with `iexcloud.io` for stock data retrieval. This also implements user level friendships/relations and the ability to follow other users and view their portfolios.

To run:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the cloned repository and run `bundle install --without production`
3. Start the Rails server by running `rails s`
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

This is also deployable to Heroku, and requires the use of PostgreSQL in "production".
